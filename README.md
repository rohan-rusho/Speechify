    }
});

btnSpeak.setOnClickListener(v -> {
    String text = inputText.getText().toString().trim();
    if (TextUtils.isEmpty(text)) {
        Toast.makeText(this, "Please enter text to speak", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        return;
    }
    tts.speak(text, TextToSpeech.QUEUE_FLUSH, null, null);
